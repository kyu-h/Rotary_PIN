Random number with rotation keypad

I got this idea from old phone which is under the picture <br>

The modern keypad is a keypad that pushes the number of the door lock type we commonly use. In this case, the number is fixed and is vulnerable to attacks such as shoulder surfing attack. Also, in case of the mobile phone lock screen, there is pattern drag method in addition to releasing the password by pressing the password, which is also vulnerable to shoulder surfing attack. The proposed scheme combines a number input method and a drag method to propose a more secure keypad. In the case of a rotating keypad, the position of a specific number is not fixed, so it is impossible to guess what number I press. <br>

In the red box the keypad is rotated and the number will change every time when you press blue box. <br>
